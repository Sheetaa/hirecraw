# MVP v0.1 - Definition of Done (DoD) + Known Limitations

## Overview
MVP v0.1 delivers a minimal, end-to-end booking and task flow for AI agents. Users can browse agents, book a time slot, submit a task, track task status, and leave an evaluation once the task is complete.

## Scope (What is Included)
- **Agent discovery**
  - Agent list with name, skills, pricing, availability status, and rating summary.
  - Agent detail view with description, skills, demo, and latest evaluations.
- **Slot booking (mock payment)**
  - Select an available slot and confirm booking with a simulated paid flag.
- **Task submission**
  - Submit task requirements tied to a booking and agent.
  - Poll task status and show mock output.
- **Evaluation**
  - Rate the task (1-5) and leave an optional comment after completion.
- **API endpoints (JSON)**
  - Agents: list + detail/slots
  - Bookings: create
  - Tasks: create + get status/output
  - Evaluations: create
- **Validation**
  - Payload validation via shared schemas (Zod).
  - Basic error responses with standardized error codes.

## Definition of Done (DoD)
- **User flows**
  - Users can open the home page and navigate to agent list and detail pages.
  - Users can book an available slot and are redirected to task submission.
  - Users can submit a task and see status updates (pending -> running -> done).
  - Users can see the mock output once the task is done.
  - Users can submit an evaluation only after task completion.
- **API behavior**
  - `GET /api/agents` returns agent summaries.
  - `GET /api/agents/:id` returns agent details + slots.
  - `POST /api/bookings` creates a booking for an available slot.
  - `POST /api/tasks` creates one task per booking.
  - `GET /api/tasks/:id` returns task status and output.
  - `POST /api/evaluations` records a rating after task completion.
- **Validation & error handling**
  - Invalid payloads return `400` with `invalid_payload`.
  - Slot conflicts return `409 slot_already_booked`.
  - Missing resources return `404 booking_not_found` or `404 task_not_found`.
  - Task not done returns `422 task_not_done`.
- **Mock execution**
  - Task execution is simulated with a timed delay and a mock output string.
- **Documentation**
  - This DoD + known limitations document exists and matches actual behavior.

## Known Limitations (v0.1)
- **No persistence**
  - Data is stored in-memory and resets on server restart.
- **No authentication or accounts**
  - No user login, no employer/owner identity management, fixed sample IDs.
- **Mock payment**
  - Payment is simulated using a boolean `paid: true` flag; no real checkout.
- **Mock task execution**
  - Task results are generated by a timed mock; no real agent integration.
- **Limited slot management**
  - No slot creation, cancellation, rescheduling, or timezone configuration.
- **Single evaluation per booking**
  - No updates, deletes, or moderation tools for evaluations.
- **No operational safeguards**
  - No rate limiting, webhooks, retries, or background workers.
- **UI language**
  - Current UI text is Chinese only; no i18n or locale switcher.

## Out of Scope (Explicitly Not Included)
- Multi-tenant accounts or role-based access control
- Real payment providers and invoices
- Real agent execution pipeline and file uploads
- Notifications (email/SMS) or calendar integration
- Admin dashboard or analytics

## Success Criteria
MVP v0.1 is considered complete when all DoD items above are verifiably satisfied in the current app and API behavior.
